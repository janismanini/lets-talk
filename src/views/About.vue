    <p>
      To practice my Vue.JS skills, I dug out this former project of mine and
      selected my favorite interviews. Enjoy :)

    <h2>About this project</h2>
    <p>
      LETS TALK THE GOOD LIFE is an online journal showcasing interviews and
      photographs of emerging entrepreneurs, selling products that have been
      manufactured as locally as possible. People with successful businesses,
      who consciously choose their materials or ingredients, producers,
      packaging and all the little bits that make a difference in a transparent
      production line. LETS TALK THE GOOD LIFE is about people with a fresh and
      happy attitude towards work, who love what they do and wish for no other
      job. About people who care.<br /><br />Since travelling and living in
      different places, I am always on the lookout for local labels. Meeting
      their makers, I take pictures and ask as many questions I can think of, in
      order to understand why they do what they do, how they came up with their
      ideas and what keeps them going. But I also try to find out what their
      biggest difficulties were on the way and what sacrifices it takes.<br /><br />LETS
      TALK THE GOOD LIFE should be understood as a platform for all people
      participating and interested, animating readers to examine their personal
      values, encouraging them to support independent producers and motivating
      some to start up something new. This way we can all learn from each other
      and stay inspired.
