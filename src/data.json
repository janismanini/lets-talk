            "Marina: For a little over ten years now I work as a designer, mainly designing furniture for other companies. Almost a year ago I've launched my own furniture label MA, where I do the product from beginning to end, to the final client."

          "title": "What were your biggest influences to start MA?",
          "answer":
            "There are several things that made me want to start my brand, but one first came up when I visited SWEDESE in 2009, a company I've worked with in Sweden. When I was there, they gave me the book about the founder of SWEDESE and it was totally inspiring! He was working on everything: designing the furniture, designing the logo, the catalogues, even the building of the company. So that's when the first thoughts came up, but just as an abstract idea. And then slowly - I continued working for other brands - this idea was growing and growing. I liked the idea to work on the whole project, from conception to production. Also to create a collection, not just a single product for one brand and then a different one for another brand, but to have a complete range that reflects more the atmosphere that I like to design and to have more freedom in the way to design, having my own brand."

          "answer":
            "Mostly the production: to find the right manufacturer for the products, the right place. So I ended up a bit by chance finding the people I'm working with now, which are just outside of Brussels. I wanted to be able to check on all the details - that way this is possible."

          "answer":
            "Cost-wise it's obviously more expensive, than it would be, being made in Eastern Europe for example. But then, with my structure - I work by myself - it actually wouldn't be cheaper to produce further away. The trip to go over there and check the production would actually increase the cost for a small scale production."

            "Yes, mostly I am. I'd say it's not so strongly an ethical question, or maybe sometimes it is, but it is also that I like nice things and they tend to be more locally made."

          "answer":
            "This really depends on times. For the past year I've almost only worked for MA. Now I'm developing a new project for IDÉE, so I will be busy for the coming months mainly working for them. I try to focus on my brand now that I started - that's where I want to put in most of my time and energy."

          "answer":
            "When I started thinking about my own label I had the idea of an online shop, because I had no other possibilities really. But then I moved studios and found this place, that allows me to have a shop - which is more a showroom than a shop, because I'm not in a commercial area at all. So people that come here are people who know my products. But I'm really glad I have that place! People get to see the furniture in real. My online shop is more an online catalogue at the moment, but still I do get requests through it - I couldn't really say if I have more sales online, or in the shop. But for me it's really important to have the physical shop."

          "answer":
            "I'd say they are definitely people who care about the product they buy. They take time to decide. Many orders that I've had, are from people that actually emailed first six months before they then order the piece."

          "answer":
            "Probably the simplicity. In a way I'm not looking for making unique pieces - that they would be special or stand out in your place. What I like is that they blend into your interior and that they can fit with any other type of furniture. I care for the quality of the product: to last, to dismantle and reassemble if needed as many times you want, without the product getting damaged."

I bought an existing business in 2006, merged the two together and spent some time working out what direction to take. In 2012 we then moved the business here and did the rebrand.

He built our house, up in New South Wales, a little stone cottage, and he was a woodworker and leather-craftsman, always working with his hands. I suppose, growing up with that, made me want to follow in his footsteps."

          "answer":
            "Well, growing up without a lot of material possessions got me thinking later, that it's all about connections, rather than living with excess. It is important to value the things we have and not just be surrounded by disposable, incidental things in our lives. \\nIf you can get something easily, it's just as easy to get rid of it. But if you invest in the process of creating it, you're more likely to cherish it and take care of it."

          "answer":
            "Plan, plan and plan. Very important! I was pretty naïve and fool-hardy, when I started. It is tricky to grind out a market for yourself, and to be competitive within an import driven economy. Everything is so cheap and easily attainable, so when you take time to hand-make something, it's difficult to convey to people the value in those things. It is hard work and you need a lot of dedication."

I think it has been in the background for a long time. We've seen the allure of the cheap and shiny and been sucked into that for a long period of time, and now we are shifting back towards what my grandparents were all about."

          "answer":
            "It's really down to what we can source, because there is very little industry in Australia and our production is quite small, so we are limited in our choices, as to what tanneries will deal with us."

So we are still working 50 or 60 hours a week, in those five days. Then, it's good to have a couple of days out of the workshop to keep a balance. \\nI guess it takes your work-time and your hobby-time and becomes one big thing, but I never really feel like it's hard work. Even though it requires a lot of my time and energy, I wouldn't do anything else, that's for sure."

I enjoy most being on the tools and making things, so if we get too big, my job becomes a manager of people and that's not what I want to do. \\nAs far as the creative side of things, the vision is to keep being innovative and challenging ourselves, coming up with new products, trying new techniques and diversifying. Having studied design, I really love furniture and product design and I could see us doing more collaborative work with furniture makers in the future. You learn a lot from collaborating with people doing similar things."

          "answer":
            "Ole: I guess my daily life is changing all the time. Setting up the company was a big struggle, because I decided to go against the stream. I had a budget of three hundred pounds plus a side job - to find materials, I went to scavenge the skips of the city. \\nFor me, life as a salmon smoker is about integrity, I'm an artisan - I believe in putting all my energy into one thing and perpetually improving. Now that we're growing, it involves other people as well, so making sure that works, is the most difficult I find now - not smoking the salmon, not keeping interest in what I do - but to motivate the staff to feel exactly the same as me. \\n\\nI grew up in the country, where you had the right to roam. During my work process I have to use all of my skills to improvise myself from stage A to B, and then C. You realize, when climbing mountains thinking: I get up on the top of this one I'll see very far, that actually if you're going to walk further, there's going to be another mountain, even higher. But at least you accumulated some kind of self esteem on the way, if you managed to succeed. I think this self esteem and that sort of urge to get further, helps you then overcome the challenges of the next mountain. \\nThen there are rivers as well - sometimes you cross a river and if you slip on a rock, you can drift with the river, or you can hold on to a stone and your knuckles will get white. You're stressed and you're holding on to something, but then you have to let go. That's where we're now, I feel: we're in a river, flowing. But for sure there will be some waterfalls, that we'll have to tackle, too.\\n\\nLife as an artisan, life as a salmon smoker, life as a father - - I'm very happy to do what I do, because I have something I believe in and I'm giving pleasure to people in terms of taste. I have an influence over the world that we live in, what means that I'm also a designer: I'm changing the perception of the world that we live in by changing the way how smoked salmon is packaged for instance: we never vacuum pack anything. We started off doing it the way my great grandfather was doing it: simply wrapping it in paper. Then I dug deeper. I had this tutor at art school that I called and we sat down for a whole day and did wrapping and packing and folding -"

            "You start caring about details, which all are so important! Once I've seen something is possible, I don't want anything else that would be the mediocre way. \\nSo right now we have a packaging, were the salmon is in direct contact with calcium carbonate, the material eggshells are made of. That means we have created the first packaging for smoked salmon, that will be sold in supermarkets, which is not vacuum packed! That's what it's all about. Making a difference and feeling a reason to get up in the morning, not just making money. \\nDoing something personal (like to play the piano for the salmon) and being straight forward about our work process, is what I enjoy. I think it is very very important, that there is substance behind things - companies used to cover themselves with a story, that was made up, but I think this is finally changing."

          "title": "How come you chose London, what made you come here?",
          "answer":
            "Yeah, good question..  I had started experimenting with sounds in that house in Stavanger [Norway], were I had loads of instruments, when one of my best friends encouraged me to apply at this art school in London to study sound art. I felt pretty alienated in my city - an oil city - there wasn't much art going on, so I was keen to find more people of the same interests. \\nAfter I got accepted the following years of creativity were amazing! I also checked out the graphic department of the school, the ceramics and metal class and just really enjoyed myself. I guess, all of these things came to use, when I decided against a pretty artist career off-the-shelf. Still I wanted to stay in London, what meant to have an income. First I did some really random business ventures, but actually got completely lost, ended up doing very little of what I wanted to do. In those jobs I couldn't find interesting people either.. I was suffering quite a lot - until I found this boiler room from the fifties outside this warehouse and it all kind of came together! \\nI felt like there'd be nothing better, than taking a family tradition and bringing it to this new place. All these childhood memories of fishing with my father and grandfather, eating an open-face salmon sandwich, sitting in my sleeping bag watching the midnight sun coming up... And since I couldn't find my place in that world of working for someone who doesn't care, but to generate profit for the share-hold, I felt the need to find a way of sustaining life on my own. Probably that was a big driver behind it. \\n\\nThen I put a lot of individualism into shaping the whole thing. Of course, you can go and hire a photographer or graphic designer, but they, unless they are really motivated and interested in what you do, will never give the same amount of passion. I rather have some tears and cries along the way - because when you believe in your ideas and you managed to solve problems, it becomes ten times more solid."

I thought, if I'll work as a florist part time, I can pursue other creative interests part time as well, which is what I did for many, many years. So floristry was only a part time thing until a few years ago, when my life took different twists and turns. I found myself wanting to do things my way, and to have a really nice lifestyle in doing that. \\nWorking from home, working with beautiful people, and not putting up with customers that expect or demand a corporate level of behaviour, but a much more relaxed and easy-going feel.

The concept originates from PERNOD RICARD, the second largest brand producing spirits. They thought they should get into the latest trend of producing hand manufactured local products, and after some time this concept by their innovation team came forward: a local product within a global project. Berlin was their first chosen city and through some circumstances they came to us. We already had an agency PAULSANDERS GMBH, focusing on marketing, PR and event  management for big brands. OUR/VODKA were actually looking for someone unfamiliar with the liquor business and we were taken by the product, the quality and had ideas to combine many things we were already doing with this new project - all under one roof.

We use a cold pressed juicer - it's a hydraulic press - so it doesn't heat any of the fruits and vegetables we're squeezing. A lot of people believe, that this keeps all the enzymes and all the nutrients in them. Essentially it does, because heat degrades everything. Heat, temperature and time: the big killers of life. Our working style is very casual and comfortable and depends on our friends. And sometimes that's really positive, because we get a lot for free, but sometimes it's really emotional, because people are putting their hearts into something and sometimes they don't feel like they're getting everything back of that."

The starting point was a dress - I wanted to find a really simple dress, that I knew I could just pick up and wear whether for working or for going out somewhere. I guess that's due to the fact, that I'm a mum now and in the morning you have to think about what your kid is going to wear, what you're going to wear... And from that it just sort of grew into other garments that I had inspiration for. Also there was a strong need for me to make the clothes myself. I love making so the handmade aspect is a really important part of it. And to go further: I am really interested in where things are coming from and where things are made, as well as natural materials and natural dyes. I love nature, gardening and I thought: maybe I start with dying my own textiles to get to know the whole process. I am not weaving my own fabrics, although we discussed with Noemi the idea of growing our own dying plants, linen…and weaving our own fabric, but I think that is a little bit optimistic for now.

So some of the fabrics I use are linen based, that come from France, which is very close, and the 100% cotton comes from India. I really wanted to find something closer, but that's impossible, because cotton doesn't grow here. I think the alternative would be to find recycled cotton or work with local fibres. But yes, it's quite difficult to find suppliers, so perhaps going to a textile fair would be good for the future productions - or growing my own linen (laughing)."

I feel nowadays that there is a big distance between the consumer and their understanding of where the products are coming from, how it's made... the younger generation it feels, doesn't seem to have an idea about how things come about. There isn't that culture anymore of sewing, knitting with your grandmother or baking... . In parallel to that, there is a group of people who are not satisfied with what's going on. These people can be quite strong about their opinion, sometimes a little extreme. I think it would be nice, if the alternative to the mainstream production would become something more natural. I will certainly communicate about the fact that the clothes are made and dyed by me here in Brussels, but I do not want it to be the focal point, I just want to show it and then let people decide. Another problem is that we are so used to see low prices, mainly for garments, so it's probably going to be difficult at first to get people to realize why it's that price. But if you go to H&M every Saturday and spend 20€ over ten weeks, that's 200€ - you are better off buying a nice top for 200€. That's the way to look at it! The quality of H&M and all these kind of brands is very low, the production isn't based on fairness, the fabric, the colours are very..."

When I see brands like APC - which is a brand that I look up to, its founder is very forward thinking and doing his thing and doing it quite well - but when I see that the garments are made in China, I just think: aargh... I heard an interview with him the other day where he said: I have to produce in China - I'd love to do it in France, but I can't, the prices are too high. And anyway, there aren't that many people prepared or able to do this stuff, so I have to do it in China. And I felt a bit like: yes - but you also want to do a good profit margin, and that you're not saying. You know, I fear that when I see that companies are making garments in Bangladesh or China, that they are being greedy and that makes me feel uncomfortable."

In my late teens and early twenties I decided to learn English, so I went to England. The idea was to come back to France to study architecture, but then I really enjoyed England and I discovered, that you could study very specific subjects like furniture, or textiles.

I started making crochet mushrooms (laughing). That was nice and I kept going and then thought: ok, what can you do? You can sew. You don't have much money, a little sewing machine, a bit of space: I am going to make collars (because I came across these patterns of crochet collars). I got myself an online shop, did the website myself, took some really nice pictures and wrote to my friends: this is what I'm doing, tell me what you think. And everyone was like: oh - it's really nice… I'm sure it's gonna be doing very well... but not much sales (laughing)! Then I went for a summer holidays in France and on my return I thought to myself: OK, this needs to work, I haven't done all this for nothing! So I wrote a nice email to magazines and the French ELLE blog picked up on it. I was very excited that orders started coming through from people I had no idea who they were! The first one was a lady on a French island in the pacific, so cool! And she bought two! Not just one! (smiling). It then became a bit of a snowball thing. But for me, I realise now, CLAUDINE & COMPAGNIE was a bit of a test. It got me to understand a lot of things and so I'm starting this new brand with a bit more experience."
